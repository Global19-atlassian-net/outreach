# Content for NodeJS Community Webpage

## Introduction

NodeJS is an Open Source software built, used, and maintained by the community. We believe community to be at the core of NodeJS' popularity. Amazing folks from different parts of the world, with a common interest, collaborate and shape this community.

Everyone is welcomed to be a part of this community. You can find hand picked resources here to learn this technology, but we hope you become a part of this community. And help write the software the way you want it to be.

On this page, you can find some useful resources to learn this software and be a part of this community.

## Want to Contribute

NodeJS is an Open Source community, and all kinds of contributions — documentation, bugs reporting, core contribution — are welcomed. Irrespective of the extent of the contribution, we encourage you to be a part of this initiative and own project.

Below are a few ways you can get involved with the community:

### Community Committee

[Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) (Comm Comm) is the highest level committee in NodeJS foundation which oversees all the outward facing community outreach efforts. You can join our Comm Comm meetings where we discuss issues, new features, and all the things that are happening in NodeJS Foundation. If you are interested in participating in the meeting, you can join via the Zoom link, or you can simply watch the meeting live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ).

### Core Contribution

If you want to help by writing code in the form of fixes, features, or an improvement, you can always explore the [NodeJS GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nodejs/node). You may start by taking a look at the issues reported by other people or by helping with the pull requests. But before doing that, please make sure you consult the [NodeJS Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests).

If you want to contribute but not sure where to start, take a look at [Node Todo](https://www.nodetodo.org). It's a great guide on getting started with your first contribution.

### Reporting a Bug

It could happen that you might find some bugs that we missed. That bug might be crashing your NodeJS or causing some irregular activities in your project. In this case, you can easily report it to us by following the steps written below.

1. You should first update to the most recent master release. It can happen that we may have already fixed your bug.

2. Search for similar issues before opening a new one. Somebody may have already reported it.

3. If you open an issue, make sure to select `🐛 Bug Report` and then follow the instructions in the template.

4. The NodeJS team will work with you until your issue has been resolved.

> To report an issue specific to NodeJS, please use [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues) page.

> To report an issue specific to [NodeJS organization website](nodejs.org), please use [nodejs/nodejs.org](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues) page.

### Requesting a Feature

Think you have some useful features in mind which you want to see implemented in the next versions of NodeJS? We would love to hear about it. You can easily report it to us. Just follow the steps written below.

1. Update to the latest node version. It can happen that we may have already introduced that feature.

2. Open an [issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues) and then select `🚀 Feature Request`. Fill out the template and then select Submit new issue.

## Code of Conduct

This community is committed to upholding the [NodeJS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/outreach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Stuck at Somewhere

Because of the level of activity in the `nodejs/node` is so high, we created a separate repo for helping purpose. [Check it out now](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues). There you'll find a lot of questions or requests for general help using NodeJS. If you still can't find the solution to your problem, all you need to do is to open an issue. After that, someone from the NodeJS foundation will contact you on that issue.
