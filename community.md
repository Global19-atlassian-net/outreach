## Introduction

Node.js ranks as the [fourth]((https://www.battery.com/powered/boss-index-tracking-explosive-growth-open-source-software/)) most important open source project according to the Battery Ventures Open Source Software (BOSS) Index. In its earliest times, when Node.js was still in its initial releases, it became extremely popular. Thousands of developers were using it. With the increasing usage, it became difficult for the Node.js core team to keep the software up to date with the user requirements. So thus formed the Node.js foundation in 2015.

The Node.js foundation came into existence to support software which had millions of download. At first, only four people were handling most of the work in the Node.js core. But now it has over a dozen working groups handling this task.

Node.js foundation is an Open Source community, and anyone can become a part of it by contributing to its projects. Contribution can be of any type. You can contribute to the documentation, or if you are a developer, you can even contribute to the core of the Node.js. There is no limit to it.

## Code of Conduct

Like every other community, the Node.js foundation has also defined some rules which every member needs to uphold. These rules are there to avoid any kind of misconduct and harassment.
