## Want to Contribute

There are multiple ways and places you can contribute. You can join our [community committees](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) meetings where we discuss issues, new features and all the things that are happening in NodeJS Foundation. If you are interested in participating in the meeting, you can join via Zoom link or you can simply watch the meeting live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ).

If you think you have found a solution to an existing issue or you have new feature in mind which you want to implement then you can contribute to the core of [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node). But before doing that please make sure you consult the [NodeJS Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests).

If you are wondering how you can contribute to the core then you should check [Node Todo](https://www.nodetodo.org). Node Todo will help you towards your first contribution.

Think you have found a bug or there is a new feature you have in mind? We would love to hear about it.

## Stuck at Somewhere

Because of the level of activity in the `nodejs/node` is so high, we created a separate repo for helping purpose. [Check it out now](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues).
