# Content for NodeJS Community Webpage

## Introduction

NodeJS is an open source software built, used, and maintained by the community. We believe community to be at the core of NodeJS' popularity. Amazing folks from different parts of the world, with a common interest, collaborate and shape this community.

In its earliest times, when Node.js was still in its initial releases, it became extremely popular. Thousands of developers were using it. With the increasing usage, it became difficult for the Node.js core team to keep the software up to date with the user requirements. So thus formed the Node.js foundation in 2015.

Node.js foundation is an open source community, and anyone can become a part of it by contributing to its projects. Open source doesn’t always have the best reputation for being friendly and welcoming, and that makes us sad. Everyone belongs in open source, and Node.js foundation is dedicated to making you feel welcome.

## Code of Conduct

Like every other community, the Node.js foundation has also defined some rules which every member needs to uphold. These rules are there to avoid any kind of misconduct and harassment.

## Want to Contribute

Node.js is an Open Source community, and all kinds of contributions — documentation, bugs reporting, core contribution — are welcomed. Irrespective of the size of the contribution, we encourage you to be a part of this initiative and own this Open Source project. If you miss a feature, request it or maybe help to build it.
