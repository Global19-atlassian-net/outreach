# Content for NodeJS Community Webpage

## Introduction

NodeJS ranks as the [fourth]((https://www.battery.com/powered/boss-index-tracking-explosive-growth-open-source-software/)) most important open source project according to the Battery Ventures Open Source Software (BOSS) Index. In its earliest times, when NodeJS was still in its initial releases, it became extremely popular. Thousands of developers were using it. With the increasing usage, it became difficult for the NodeJS core team to keep the software up to date with the user requirements. So thus formed the NodeJS foundation in 2015.

The NodeJS foundation came into existence to support software which had millions of download. At first, only four people were handling most of the work in the NodeJS core. But now it has over a dozen working groups handling this task.

NodeJS foundation is an Open Source community, and anyone can become a part of it by contributing to its projects. Contribution can be of any type. You can contribute to the documentation, or if you are a developer, you can even contribute to the core of the NodeJS. There is no limit to it.

## Want to Contribute

NodeJS is an Open Source community, and all kinds of contributions ‚Äî documentation, bugs reporting, core contribution ‚Äî are welcomed. Irrespective of the size of the contribution, we encourage you to be a part of this initiative and own this Open Source project. If you miss a feature, request it or maybe help to build it.

### Comm Comm

There are multiple avenues you can use to get involved in the NodeJS foundation. You can join our [community committees](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) meetings where we discuss issues, new features, and all the things that are happening in NodeJS Foundation. If you are interested in participating in the meeting, you can join via the Zoom link, or you can simply watch the meeting live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ).

### Core Contribution

If you think you have found a solution to an existing issue or you have new feature in mind which you want to implement then you can contribute to the core of [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node). But before doing that, please make sure you consult the [NodeJS Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests).

Making your first contribution to the core can be tough. Visit [Node Todo](https://www.nodetodo.org), where you will find all the necessary help you need to make your first contribution.

## Code of Conduct

Like every other community, the NodeJS foundation has also defined some rules which every member needs to uphold. [Click here](https://github.com/nodejs/outreach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to see the Code of Conduct.

## Stuck at Somewhere

Because of the level of activity in the `nodejs/node` is so high, we created a separate repo for helping purpose. [Check it out now](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues). There you'll find a lot of questions or requests for general help using NodeJS. If you still can't find the solution to your problem, all you need to do is to open an issue. After that, someone from the NodeJS foundation will contact you on that issue.
